				<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
				<div>
					<p>
						This privacy policy will explain what information we collect online, why we collect it, and the choices we
						offer to you.
					</p>
					<p>
						This privacy policy (“Policy”) describes the data practices of Canopy Limited and its subsidiaries
						(collectively, the “we”, or “Company”), covering its services under its control, including this website, any
						products, mobile applications, console or PC applications (collectively "Services"). By using the Services,
						you are consenting to this Policy and the processing of your data in the manner provided in this Policy. If
						you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the Services. This Privacy Policy was last updated on{' '}
						<strong>September 10, 2018.</strong>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>Information we collect</h4>
					<p>
						We may collect information about the Services you use and how you use them, such as the selections you make
						on our Services. We collect PII, DII, and log information about your interactions as described below.
					</p>
					<p>
						Personally identifiable information (PII) is information that can be used to identify or contact you online
						or offline, such as your name, address, email, phone number, photos or audio data, and payment information.
						The Services may collect PII when it is provided to us, such as when you use our Services, attempt to
						contact us, submit a resume or job application, or connect with us on social media or one of our partners.
						For example, you may see a “Log in with…” button, which means we request PII from a partner to streamline
						the login process. You will likely be presented with a “request for permission” screen by a third party
						asking to share your ID, profile picture, and other listed information with us.{' '}
					</p>
					<p>
						We may also create or collect device-identifiable information (DII), such as cookies, unique device and
						advertising identifiers, usernames, and similar identifiers that are linkable to a browser or device. From
						these platforms, we may also receive other information, such as your IP address, user agent, timestamps,
						precise and imprecise geolocation, sensor data, apps, fonts, battery life information, and screen size.{' '}
					</p>
					<p>
						Our Services also collect information about your interactions, including navigation paths, search queries,
						crashes, timestamps, purchases, clicks and shares, and referral URLs. We may combine this data with PII and
						DII. For efficiency’s sake, information about your interactions may be transmitted to our servers while you
						are not using the app. We may also partner with third parties that collect additional information – please
						see their privacy policies for more details and see below for your choices regarding these parties.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>How we use information we collect</h4>
					<p>
						We use the information we collect from our Services to provide, maintain, protect and improve our Services,
						to develop new Services and offerings, and to protect us and our users.{' '}
					</p>
					<p>
						PII is primarily used for business purposes, such as for sending you occasional newsletters and updates,
						hiring, responding to inquiries, logins, and providing Services. When you contact us, we may keep a record
						of your communication as well as the other information to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may
						use your email address to inform you about our Services, such as letting you know about changes or
						improvements. Please keep in mind that comments sections, forums, and other similar areas of our Services
						are public. Any information posted in those areas is viewable and usable by anyone that has access.
					</p>
					<div>
						<p>
							We share PII with companies, outside organizations, and individuals for limited reasons, outlined below:
						</p>
						<ol className="roman-caps">
							<li>
								With your consent - We will share PII with companies, outside organizations or individuals if we have
								your consent to do so.{' '}
							</li>
							<li>
								For external processing - We provide PII to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to
								process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other
								appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
							</li>
							<li>
								For legal reasons - We will share PII with companies, outside organizations or individuals if we have a
								good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably
								necessary to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request,
								detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues or protect against harm to the
								rights, property or safety of our users or the public as required or permitted by law.{' '}
							</li>
							<li>
								In case of a sale or asset transfer - If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other
								transaction involving the sale of some or all of our assets, user information, including PII collected
								from you through your use of our Services, could be included in the transferred assets. Should such an
								event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you, either through email and/or a prominent notice
								on the Services.
							</li>
							<li>
								In aggregated form for business purposes - We may share aggregated information and DII with our partners
								such as businesses we have a relationship with, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may
								share information to show trends about the general use of our Services.
							</li>
							<p>
								We use DII to operate our Services and manage user sessions, including analyzing usage of our Services,
								preventing malicious behavioral and fraud, improving the content, to link your identity across devices
								and browsers in order to provide you with a more seamless experience online, and helping third parties
								provide relevant advertising and related metrics. We share DII with third parties primarily for
								advertising and analytics purposes, for external processing, and for security purposes.
							</p>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h4>Third Parties</h4>
						<p>
							While we strive to work with reputable companies with good privacy practices, this Policy does not apply
							to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed
							to you on the Services. We also do not control the privacy policies and your privacy settings on
							third-party sites, including social networks. We may use third parties to help offer you more tailored ads
							and better Services, such as obtaining analytics about the users of our site and to help tailor
							advertising to your preferences. For further information, please see the relevant privacy policies for
							each third party and industry codes of conduct.{' '}
						</p>
						<h4>Choice</h4>
						<div>
							<p>
								Like many other companies, we do not honor DNT flags but instead offer other choices with respect to
								third parties. Many third parties participate in self-regulation to offer you a choice regarding
								receiving targeted ads. Please note that you’ll still see generic ads after opting out, but they won’t
								be based on your activities online. On the web, you can opt out of participating companies by visiting
								the following sites:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/</a>
								</li>
								<li>
									<a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/ ">http://optout.aboutads.info/ </a>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								If you wish to similarly opt out of cross-app advertising on mobile devices, you can enable the Limit Ad
								Tracking flag on the device. Enabling Limit Ad Tracking sends a flag to third parties that you wish to
								opt out of targeted advertising on that device, and major mobile platforms require companies to honor
								this flag. Screenshots on how to find these options on various devices are available here:{' '}
								<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices">
									http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices.
								</a>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h4>Accessing and updating your information</h4>
							<p>
								We aim to provide you with reasonable opportunity to access, update, and delete to your PII. In some
								cases, we may have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating
								your information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h4>Information security</h4>
							<p>
								We work hard to protect our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or
								destruction of information we hold and undertake reasonable security measures with appropriate
								confidentiality, integrity, and availability protections. However, since no software or storage system
								is 100% secure, we cannot guarantee the security of your information associated with the Services, or
								any other service for that matter. You can help protect your account information by using unique and
								hard-to-guess passwords.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h4>Children Under 13</h4>
							<p>
								We do not knowingly collect information for any child under the age of 13. If you are the parent of a
								child under the age of 13 and have a concern regarding your child’s information on our Services, please
								contact us at the email provided at the end of this Policy.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h4>Our Services are Located in the United States</h4>
							<p>
								Our Services are directed to United States citizens. If you are outside of the United States, your
								information will be processed and stored in the United States and you are consenting to such transfer,
								processing, and storage under the laws of the United States.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>

										If you are not able to satisfactorily resolve a Dispute informally within a total of thirty (30)
										days, or if Canopy Limited, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that it will not be
										possible to satisfactorily resolve that Dispute informally within a total of thirty (30) days, you
										agree that either you or Canopy Limited may request resolution by final and fully binding
										arbitration conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
										Association. The party requesting that a Dispute be resolved by arbitration under this Section shall
										be responsible for initiating such a proceeding.
									</span>
									<ol className="roman">
										<li>
											The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will run the arbitration between you and Canopy
											Limited, and AAA’s rules and procedures (including their Supplementary Procedures for
											Consumer-Related Disputes, if applicable) will be used. If something in these Terms is different
											than AAA’s rules and procedures, then we will follow these Terms instead. You can look at AAA’s
											rules and procedures on their website www.adr.org or you can call them at 1-800-778-7879.
										</li>
										<li>
											YOU UNDERSTAND, AND FURTHER AGREE, THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONSULT WITH INDEPENDENT LEGAL
											COUNSEL OF YOUR OWN CHOOSING REGARDING THIS AND ANY OTHER PROVISION IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT
											THIS BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL ELIMINATE YOUR LEGAL RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT, TO HAVE A JURY
											TRIAL, AND/OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH DISPUTE. You and Canopy
											Limited both agree that neither shall attempt to have any other arbitration or class action
											related to any other party joined to any arbitration in which you are involved with Canopy
											Limited. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no arbitration proceeding shall be decided on a
											class-action basis or utilizing class action procedures. You and Canopy Limited further agree that
											each may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or
											a class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.
